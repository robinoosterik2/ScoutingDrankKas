# ScoutingDrankKas
I created the ScoutingDrankKas as a system to sell and manage drinks effectively, providing a seamless experience for users and barkeepers at my scouting.

I am planning on adding a lot of features to the system, but for now I am focusing on the basics. The system is built with Nuxt 3 and uses a MongoDB database.
